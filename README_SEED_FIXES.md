# Seed Data Validation Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes made to resolve validation errors in the seed database script.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Customer Model - Missing `createdBy` Field**
**Error**: `Customer validation failed: createdBy: Path 'createdBy' is required.`

**Fix**: 
- Added `createdBy` field to Customer model
- Updated seed data to include `createdBy: users[0]._id` for all customers

### 2. **Product Model - Missing `createdBy` Field**
**Error**: Product controller was setting `createdBy` but model didn't have the field

**Fix**:
- Added `createdBy` field to Product model
- Added index for `createdBy` field
- Updated seed data to include `createdBy: users[0]._id` for all products

### 3. **User Model - Missing `createdBy` Field**
**Error**: User controller was setting `createdBy` but model didn't have the field

**Fix**:
- Added `createdBy` field to User model (not required for initial users)
- Added index for `createdBy` field
- Initial seed users don't have `createdBy` field

### 4. **PurchaseOrder Model - Missing `poNumber` Field**
**Error**: `PurchaseOrder validation failed: poNumber: PO Number is required.`

**Fix**:
- Added `poNumber` field to all purchase orders in seed data
- Used format: `PO-2024-001`, `PO-2024-002`, etc.

### 5. **Sale Model - Missing `invoiceNumber` Field**
**Error**: Sale model requires `invoiceNumber` field

**Fix**:
- Added `invoiceNumber` field to all sales in seed data
- Used format: `INV-2024-001`, `INV-2024-002`, etc.

### 6. **Purchase Model - Missing `receiptNumber` Field**
**Error**: Purchase model requires `receiptNumber` field

**Fix**:
- Added `receiptNumber` field to all purchases in seed data
- Used format: `REC-2024-001`, `REC-2024-002`, etc.

## Model Updates Made

### Customer Model (`models/Customer.js`)
```javascript
createdBy: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: "User",
  required: true,
},
```

### Product Model (`models/Product.js`)
```javascript
createdBy: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: "User",
  required: true,
},
```

### User Model (`models/User.js`)
```javascript
createdBy: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: "User",
  required: false, // Not required for initial users
},
```

## Seed Data Updates

### Purchase Orders
- Added `poNumber` field with format `PO-2024-XXX`
- 5 purchase orders with different statuses

### Sales
- Added `invoiceNumber` field with format `INV-2024-XXX`
- 8 sales with different customers and statuses

### Purchases
- Added `receiptNumber` field with format `REC-2024-XXX`
- 8 purchases with different vendors

## How to Test

1. **Clear existing data** (if any):
   ```bash
   mongosh
   use inventory_management
   db.users.deleteMany({})
   db.products.deleteMany({})
   db.vendors.deleteMany({})
   db.customers.deleteMany({})
   db.purchaseorders.deleteMany({})
   db.sales.deleteMany({})
   db.purchases.deleteMany({})
   ```

2. **Run the seed script**:
   ```bash
   cd inventory-saas-backend
   npm run seed
   ```

3. **Expected output**:
   ```
   Connected to MongoDB
   Cleared existing data
   Seeding users...
   Created 3 users
   Seeding vendors...
   Created 20 vendors
   Seeding customers...
   Created 20 customers
   Seeding products...
   Created 25 products
   Creating sample purchase orders...
   Created 5 purchase orders
   Creating sample sales...
   Created 8 sales
   Creating sample purchases...
   Created 8 purchases
   Database seeding completed successfully!
   ```

## Notes

- All models now have consistent `createdBy` fields where appropriate

- All prices are in Indian Rupees (₹)
- Tax calculations use 12% GST rate
- All data is realistic and suitable for testing
